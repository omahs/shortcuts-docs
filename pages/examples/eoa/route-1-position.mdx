In this example, we will have a user that has [1 WETH](https://etherscan.io/token/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2) in their Ethereum mainnet wallet, and wants to deposit 1 WETH into [Beefy Aura wstETH-ETH](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe0d5f9da3613c047003b77caa31270abe3eda6b0)

## Step 1: Approve

The user must approve the WETH first on the contract so that the contract can execute the bundle of transactions.

### Approve: Fetch address

Each user has their own respective routing contract which will be deployed, and executed in the same transaction when the execution transaction is submitted. This reduces the risks of approvals with a single-point of failure contract, and the user that is submitting the transaction is the owner of that contract not Enso, further reducing the risk.

Fetch address to approve:

```bash copy
curl -X GET \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  "https://api.enso.finance/api/v1/wallet?chainId=1&fromAddress=0x57757E3D981446D585Af0D9Ae4d7DF6D64647806"
```

```javascript
chainid: "Chain ID to execute the approval on", // 1 = Ethereum Mainnet, [full networks](../networks)
fromAddress: "EOA address that is executing the approval", // 0x57757E3D981446D585Af0D9Ae4d7DF6D64647806
```

You will be returned with:

```json
{
  "address": "0xD6A4217CF6A3587B4E33e9a59C52BF57469e713a", // Individual contract owned by the EOA
  "isDeployed": false
}
```

If the user has already used Enso through another integrator, then `isDeployed` will be true.

### Approve: Approve Transaction

Enso:

```bash copy
curl -X GET \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer 1e02632d-6feb-4a75-a157-documentation" \
  "https://api.enso.finance/api/v1/wallet/approve?chainId=1&fromAddress=0x57757E3D981446D585Af0D9Ae4d7DF6D64647806&tokenAddress=0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2&amount=1000000000000000000000000000"
```

Ethers:

```javascript
await ERC20(0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2).approve(address, 5 Ether) // take decimals of the token you're approving into account
```

## Step 2: Execute

### Execute: Build actions

We are using the [Route action](../../bundler-api/actions/route) inside of the [Bundle endpoint](../../bundler-api/api-reference/overview) as this action compares the best execution route for token amount out, and gas execution price. For example, it might be better to purchase yvWETH on a secondary exchange than directly depositing it depending upon the exchange rate of that token on the secondary market.

```bash copy
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer 1e02632d-6feb-4a75-a157-documentation" \
  "https://api.enso.finance/api/v1/shortcuts/route?chainId=1&fromAddress=0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045&priceImpact=false&toEoa=true&amountIn=1000000000000000000&slippage=300&tokenIn=0xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee&tokenOut=0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84"
```

The `data` value contains the bundle calldata to be submitted to the user.
