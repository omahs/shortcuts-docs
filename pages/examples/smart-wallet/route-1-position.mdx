# Enter 1 position from 1 token

In this example, we have a smart wallet (e.g. Gnosis Safe, Enso Smart Wallet) that is holding [1 WETH](https://etherscan.io/token/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2), and wants to: 4. Deposit 1 WETH into [Beefy Aura wstETH-ETH](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe0d5f9da3613c047003b77caa31270abe3eda6b0)

### Set Smart-wallet address

You will need to set the smart wallet address in the `fromAddress` field.
If you are using an Enso Smart Wallet, and don't remember the address you can fetch using the metadata API (command below).
If you know your address or you are using another smart wallet such as Safe, you can skip to the next step.

```bash copy
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://api.enso.finance/api/v1/wallet?chainId=1&fromAddress=<EOA_ADDRESS>' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

It returns the following:

```json
{
  "address": "0xD6A4217CF6A3587B4E33e9a59C52BF57469e713a", // Enso Smart Wallet Address
  "isDeployed": true
}
```

## Step 2: Execute

### Execute: Fetch the actions

We are using the [Route action](../../bundler-api/actions/route) inside of the [Bundle endpoint](../../bundler-api/api-reference/overview) as this action compares the best execution route for token amount out, and gas execution price. For example, it might be better to purchase yvWETH on a secondary exchange than directly depositing it depending upon the exchange rate of that token on the secondary market.
Note that the we set `toEoA` to _false_, as we are using a smart wallet.

```bash copy
curl -X POST 'https://api.enso.finance/api/v1/shortcuts/route?chainId=1& \
fromAddress=0xD6A4217CF6A3587B4E33e9a59C52BF57469e713a&priceImpact=false& \
toEoa=false&amountIn=1000000000000000000 \
&slippage=300&tokenIn=0xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee \
&tokenOut=0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer 1e02632d-6feb-4a75-a157-documentation'
```

The `data` value contains the bundle calldata to be submitted to the user.
