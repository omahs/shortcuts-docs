# Contract Account(Smart Wallet)

Applications that enable Smart Wallets to interact with their platform or are an application leveraging Smart Wallets can utilize Enso for all [Tokenized Interactions](/concepts/tokenized-nontokenized/tokenized.mdx) and [Non-Tokenized Interactions](/concepts/tokenized-nontokenized/nontokenized.mdx).

All interactions that are done from a Contract Account will result in the corresponding tokens and state being stored inside of the Contract Account. For example, if a user borrows on Aave, and then leverages the borrowed tokens then the borrowed tokens, leveraged state will be stored and associated to the Contract Account.
